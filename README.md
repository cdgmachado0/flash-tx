# Flashbots Arbitrage
This project is the recreation of a Flashbots arbitrage transaction made on May 14th, 2021 (pre-London). 

According to the MEV-explore dashboard, it initially had a profit of $2,156,968.55, but after re-doing the transaction, I came up with a different P/L which I back up with on-chain data, Flashbots documentation and a confirmation from their Discord server around the variance between numbers.
